The MapServer Docs
=====================================

The MapServer's Git repository can be found `here: <http://www.github.com/empireryan/mapServer>`_

The intent of this module is to allow for researchers to interface GIS data with decision making algorithms, controllers, and etc.

The operation of the module can be understood in two broad sections, namely:

* The Server
* The Map Abstraction Layer

Generally speaking, the server listens for requests. These requests consist of general API calls, or requests for a computed
trajectory.
