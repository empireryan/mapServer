    This page describes the use of the MapServer module for interfacing decision making algorithms with geographic data.
    It is based on GDAL, Rasterio, and SocketServer.

    This is not an exhaustive description, but it should allow you to start and implement map servers for
    your own uses.

Introduction
#############

The reStructuredText (RST) syntax provides an easy-to-read, what-you-see-is-what-you-get plaintext markup syntax and parser system. However, you need to be very precise and stick to some strict rules:

    * like Python, RST syntax is sensitive to indentation !
    * RST requires blank lines between paragraphs

This entire document is written with the RST syntax. In the right sidebar, you should find a link **show source**, which shows the RST source code.
